<h2>More beans to the people.</h2>
<p>As you know by now. We at Odin love beans. This another recipe which will have you crave beans for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Enjoy.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Minced garlic - I like 3 to 4 minced cloves of garlic in this dish, but feel free to alter this amount based on your preference.</li>
  <li>Extra virgin olive oil - A generous drizzle of EVOO to finish the dish adds a nice silkiness to the sauce.</li>
  <li>Canned cannellini beans - You'll need 2 cans of cannellini beans, drained and rinsed. Other white beans such as butter beans and great northern beans would also work well in this recipe.</li>
  <li>Halved cherry tomatoes - Just a cup of cherry tomatoes adds color and a hint of bright acidity.</li>
  <li>Aleppo pepper - I love the subtle tang and hint of sweetness that comes from Aleppo pepper in this recipe.</li>
  <li>Cumin - Its earthiness is the perfect base for the other flavors to balance on.</li>
  <li>Chopped fresh parsley - Few herbs elevate a dish as easily as fresh parsley does!</li>
  <li>Grated cheese - A combination of parmesan cheese and Pecorino Romano (which is a dense, nutty, sharp cheese) add tantalizing umami to this white beans recipe. If you can’t find one or the other, you can use just parmesan or Pecorino Romano, but the combination together is a good balance of salty tang and nuttiness.</li>
  <li>Fresh lemon juice - A squeeze of lemon juice instantly brightens this dish, enhancing its creamy, tangy flavors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Sauté the garlic and beans. In a large pan, sauté 3 to 4 minced garlic cloves in heated olive oil over medium heat. Once the garlic is golden, add 2 15-ounce cans of cannellini beans that have been drained, and about ½ cup of water. Season with kosher salt, black pepper, 1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper, and ½ teaspoon cumin.</li>
  <li>Add the tomatoes, fresh parsley, and cheese. Add 1 cup of halved cherry tomatoes, and cook for about 10 minutes, until the beans and tomatoes are warmed through and the tomatoes have softened a bit. Stir in the chopped fresh parsley, ¼ to ⅓ cup shaved parmesan, ¼ cup grated Pecorino Romano, and the juice of half a lemon.</li>
  <li>Serve! Drizzle extra virgin olive oil generously to finish the white beans dish, and serve immediately.
